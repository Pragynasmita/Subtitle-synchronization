1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,879
We will welcome the amazing crops of this year with some hot delicious laddoos.

2
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,920
Yes, Do La Kpur has had such a good harvest after so many years.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Yes.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
A happy occasion like this must be celebrated.

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,560
But be careful, the children might try to steal the laddoos even before you distribute them.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Mmm!

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
I'll catch her attention and you take the laddoos.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:01:03,560
The moment they look somewhere else, we will attack on those delicious laddoos.

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Chutki, Masu, look over there.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
There's a beautiful kite in the sky.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Oh!

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Oh!

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
But Raju, where is the kite?

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Over there.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
It's hidden behind the tree now.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
It came out.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
We didn't watch.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Leave!

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Go away!

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
These are mine!

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,560
When children don't have anything to do, they become really mischievous.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Oh no!

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Our kite doesn't have laddoos today.

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Just hide!

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Just hide!

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,560
We were just about to get those laddoos.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
But Chutki and Beam came and spoiled the whole plan.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,560
We didn't spoil the plan.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
You spoiled the plan.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,560
I am not going to spare both of you.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh!

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Oh!

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Get back here, Big One!

34
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Beam!

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I am so huge that I'm unable to hide behind these teeny tiny bushes.

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Oh!

37
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Get out of your otherwise!

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Yay!

39
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Come out, say it, girl!

40
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
You're scared!

41
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
But the bushes are shivering!

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
No!

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
No!

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
I am not scared!

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I was just trying to look for a weapon to scare away those bulls.

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Oh, Beam!

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh, you're all young!

48
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
You're all young!

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh, Beam!

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Oh, Beam!

51
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Oh, Beam!

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Oh, Beam!

53
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Oh, Beam!

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
So what do you weird experiments out there?

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Oh no!

56
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Oh!

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Oh!

58
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Beam!

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
But who's doing these experiments?

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
I am doing them.

61
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Look over here, here.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Up here.

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
My name is Raman.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Actually, I'm a Bianca's nephew.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
And like him, I'm also an expert in science.

66
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Three nabbehown.

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Huh?

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Three nabbehown.

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,560
And this is my robot called Dumbo.

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Dumbo?

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Why Dumbo?

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Because he's an expert in goofing up.

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
In every job he does.

74
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Three nabbehown.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Stop it!

76
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Hey!

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Huh?

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Three nabbehown.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Huh?

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Three nabbehown.

81
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Three nabbehown.

82
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
But why is he throwing out everything?

83
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Because I have given him the order to clean up the house.

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Three nabbehown.

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Hmm.

86
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Only call your config, Sima.

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Three nabbehown.

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Three nabbehown.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Huh?

90
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Not a boy.

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Three nabbehown.

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Three nabbehown.

93
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Stop it, you bitch!

94
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh!

95
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
How do I stop your Dumbo?

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
By pressing off his switch.

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Huh?

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Huh?

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Three nabbehown.

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Three nabbehown.

101
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I am.

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I am.

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Oh no!

104
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
He is now going to iron up all the clothes.

105
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Hmm?

106
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
So what's the big problem in that?

107
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Well the problem is Dumbo will also iron those clothes which everyone is already wearing.

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Oh!

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I am all the clothes.

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Who is this?

111
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Who is this?

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Who is this?

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Who?

114
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I am.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Stop it!

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Leave me!

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Leave me!

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Who?

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Who?

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
I am the God!

121
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Who is this?

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Who is this?

123
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Who is this?

124
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Who is this?

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,060
injured.

126
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Who is this?

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Who is this?

128
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
I am.

129
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Oh?

130
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
All the clothes.

131
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,560
I am.

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
All the clothes.

133
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,560
I am all flourish.

134
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,060
I am.

135
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
All the clothes.

136
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
I am.

137
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,959
All the clothes.

138
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,959
Huh?

139
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,459
This is the button to switch him off.

140
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,959
Oh!

141
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,959
94!

142
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:00,959
Looks like Boss is going to touch hard weight this time.

143
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
Yes, just like him.

144
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,959
Hey Boss, just three more to go.

145
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,959
And you will touch 100.

146
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,959
Oh!

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Oh!

148
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh!

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Oh!

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Oh!

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Oh!

152
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Oh!

153
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Oh!

154
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Oh!

155
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Huh?

156
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Huh?

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh!

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Do you think I am a nom school?

159
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Huh?

160
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
No, of course not Boss.

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Though I don't know about the nom bit,

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,960
but you are definitely not just a school.

163
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,960
You both are going to have it from me.

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Stop!

165
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Stop both of you!

166
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Huh?

167
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Huh?

168
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Come on Kaliya, let them be.

169
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Why don't you do your work and let me and my boys do whatever we want to, huh?

170
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
That reminds me, Bhim.

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Professor Dhumke had called you to his laboratory for some work.

172
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,960
It's about something called a lawa card.

173
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Everyone just calls Bhim all the time.

174
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
He doesn't Professor Dhumke to ever call me for any work.

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Had that been of any use, he would have surely called.

176
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
What did you just say?

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I was just saying that he or the one and only

178
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
were famous wrestler of Dholakpur.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,960
So you can walk in un-invited anywhere Kaliya boss.

180
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
You got a point.

181
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
So let's go.

182
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,960
This is my lawa card.

183
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
But where is the lawa uncle?

184
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Well kids, if I had really put boiling lawa into this,

185
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,960
do you think making this machine, I mean this car would have been possible?

186
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Of course not.

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Hot molten lawa can even melt steel.

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,960
And when it cools down, it becomes solid and heavy as a rock.

189
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,960
That is why instead of using actual lawa in this car of mine,

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I have used certain new chemicals which mimic the properties of real molten lawa.

191
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,960
But what does this car actually do uncle?

192
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Well actually I have made this for car racing you see.

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,960
For car racing I was thinking if you can trial this car out, Bhim.

194
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Why Bhim? Why not me?

195
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Yeah, what were you doing behind the bushes?

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,960
He was hardly listening to what you were discussing.

197
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,960
If anyone gets to trial this car first, that should be me.

198
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,960
He would be able to understand the intricacies of this car or not.

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Instead of understanding intricacies, boss understands delicacies better.

200
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Although all the controls are inside the car, but for the sake of convenience,

201
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I have made this remote for it.

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Which would be used by us?

203
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Down, dole, dole.

204
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,960
No bro.

205
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Dole, dole, stop it now.

206
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Come on, why can't we both have a little fun Bhim?

207
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I am just driving out everything in this new car.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Kalyo.

209
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Crazy smoke.

210
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Oh no, what's this?

211
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Oh no.

212
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh no.

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Oh no.

214
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Oh no, the way.

215
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Bhim, pick this.

216
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Don't worry, everything is fine.

217
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Bhim, hope you didn't get hurt and how's Kalyo?

218
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Yes, we are fine, but your car.

219
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Well, let me take this vehicle back to my laboratory.

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh my bones are aching so badly.

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Do you really have any bones?

222
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I thought it's only fat in there.

223
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Oh no.

224
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Greetings, my lord.

225
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Come Bhim, well kids, there's a lovely mountain at the border of Tolakpur called Neely Pahari.

226
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I want you all to go there on a holiday trip.

227
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Whatever trekking gear, tents and all you would need for that,

228
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I'll provide them, consider it a small gift from me.

229
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm sure you're all going to enjoy this camping trip.

230
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
So are you all willing?

231
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Yes, my lord.

232
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Neely Pahari.

233
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,960
This is nowhere close to the Kalablu.

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,960
And why is this called Blue Mountain on Neely Pahari?

235
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
You fools!

236
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
That's just a name, a name.

237
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Having luck, do's at night is much more fun, guys.

238
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Heaven knows what's there on top of that mountain where that old battery was bought.

239
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Raju, this is a holiday trip.

240
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,960
We are here to have a look at the mountain.

241
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,960
We are here to have a look at the mountain.

242
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,960
We are here to have a look at the mountain.

243
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I'll be on guard duty, all of you go to sleep.

244
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Let's go to sleep then.

245
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Be Ms. Protecting Everyone even here.

246
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Lucky does a dole of poor.

247
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
But it's a good thing that we're here to have a look at the mountain.

248
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm going to sleep.

249
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,960
We're here to have a look at the mountain.

250
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,960
He does a dole of poor.

251
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Let me do the guarding.

252
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
But Kalia.

253
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Neely Pahari's expert is Kalia the wrestler.

254
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll do the guard duty. Rest will sleep.

255
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I won't sleep.

256
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Neely Pahari's expert.

257
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Kalia.

258
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I'll do the guard duty.

259
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,960
And he's snoring away.

260
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
What happened?

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Kalia, we have been robbed.

262
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
What?

263
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Someone else is also here.

264
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Come on, guys.

265
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Come on, guys.

266
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Come on.

267
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Catch the thieves.

268
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Come on.

269
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Come on.

270
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Teach us.

271
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
You guys and you?

272
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,960
All our campings, staff.

273
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
What are you doing at Neely Pahari now?

274
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
What is this?

275
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Dole of poor's beam will scale.

276
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Neely Pahari soon.

277
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Ades are all buffoons.

278
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
By sending such a message to Pahal Manpur,

279
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
you've definitely insulted us, beam.

280
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I'll never stoop so low.

281
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Now you're lying since you're scared, beam.

282
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,960
We've come here for a few days on a trip, Kichak.

283
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
My dear citizens of Kerala.

284
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Today is one of the happiest days in all our lives.

285
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
This ancient idol, which was stolen from our state,

286
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
nearly a thousand of years ago,

287
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,960
has been successfully recovered and brought back to our state

288
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
after years of searching.

289
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,960
This unique idol was the pride of our state

290
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
and will always remain so.

291
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,960
We will install it back in its temple in the forthcoming festival.

292
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Now no one can snatch it from our state ever again.

293
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Yes, no one except me.

294
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Guards go!

295
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Oh!

296
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,960
My lord, whatever happened is indeed very sad,

297
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
but please don't waste your time worrying about it.

298
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,960
That unknown thief will be caught very shortly.

299
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
All our people are waiting eagerly for the festival.

300
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Many more arrangements are yet to be made

301
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,960
and this year the special invitation of the festival

302
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,960
has already been sent to your friend his majesty of Thulakpur King Indravarma.

303
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,960
98, 99, 100.

304
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Are you ready now?

305
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Not as yet.

306
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Ready guys?

307
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Not so fast.

308
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm coming now.

309
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Hmm?

310
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Hmm?

311
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Hmm?

312
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Hmm?

313
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Hmm?

314
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Hmm?

315
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Hmm?

316
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Hmm?

317
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Hmm?

318
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Where is everyone hiding?

319
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I could always catch them so easily.

320
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Hmm?

321
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Oh yes, this technique is not going to work.

322
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,960
I have got to use my brain a bit

323
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
and use this yummy laddo.

324
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Oh!

325
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I found one last laddo was left in my back friends.

326
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Well, this is the only one I have.

327
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh!

328
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Hey, beam you're out.

329
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Anyone would do this for such a nice laddo.

330
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I agree completely.

331
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Now this last laddo is all mine.

332
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
My, my, my, my, my.

333
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Well, not so easily Jaggu.

334
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Oh!

335
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Finally this laddo is in the hands of its rightful owner.

336
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,960
In that case, I should be its only rightful owner.

337
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
So, huh?

338
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,960
You better admit that today's not your day beam

339
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
give up now.

340
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
The game is over.

341
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
The game is not over yet my friend

342
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,960
because I don't give up that easily.

343
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Huh?

344
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Well, we may have just one laddo

345
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
but if you agree we all can share it.

346
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Where kids?

347
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,960
There can be no shortage of laddoos

348
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,960
till your ten to nondis there.

349
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Yeah, you can all have them.

350
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh!

351
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
What nonsense is this?

352
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Hold, I say.

353
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
You can't escape from us.

354
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
God's, catch that thief.

355
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Don't let him run away.

356
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Wait, I'll catch this rascal.

357
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
This thief is quite a jile.

358
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Hey boss, we never knew you were so good at head banging.

359
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh really?

360
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Then let me bang your knuckleheads now.

361
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,960
I must say this boy is so strong.

362
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Huh?

363
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
What?

364
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
What?

365
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
You better have some good explanations ready for this, mister.

366
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Huh?

367
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Huh?

368
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Hey, he's just a young boy.

369
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,960
I will teach this muddy a nice lesson right now.

370
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Just wait.

371
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Hold on Kaliya.

372
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Let's first find out.

373
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Why this boy attempted to steal this amulet?

374
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
I know how to make him speak.

375
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
No wait Kaliya.

376
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Let me ask him.

377
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You could have easily escaped.

378
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,960
But I know for sure you're not a robber.

379
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
And you're surely in some kind of trouble.

380
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Tell us everything.

381
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Maybe we can be of some help to you.

382
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
No, no, don't cry.

383
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
No one is your enemy out here.

384
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
And believe me, all of us are going to help you.

385
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Take a look.

386
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I've come all the way here in search of this thing.

387
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,960
This is a picture of the same amulet beam.

388
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Who are you?

389
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
And where did you get this from?

390
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
My name is Dure.

391
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,960
And my father gave me this map.

392
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
When a village was attacked.

393
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Huh?

394
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
But who attacked your village?

395
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
And what for?

396
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,960
This is not any ordinary amulet.

397
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,960
This is one half of the world's most popular amulet.

398
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
This is one half of the most powerful amulet on earth.

399
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Our village has been guarding this amulet for thousands of years.

400
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
But a thousand year back,

401
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,960
a crook named Saraku stole this amulet from our village.

402
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
He misused the powers of this amulet.

403
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,960
And turned all Africans into his slaves.

404
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
But once slave didn't accept this slavery.

405
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
His name was Uji.

406
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Uji challenged Saraku's for a fight.

407
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,960
And their battle went on for many days.

408
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Saraku's was much stronger and powerful than Uji.

409
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
But Uji didn't give up.

410
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,960
And in his final attack, he broke the amulet into two.

411
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
And with a loud bang,

412
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,960
both the halves of the amulet vanished forever.

413
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
The secret of finding out and joining the parts of this amulet again

414
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
has been written down in this map.

415
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
And my father used to protect this map.

416
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
To get hold of this secret,

417
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Girboro Atata village.

418
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
No.

419
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Who is this Girboro?

420
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
He is an evil tribal leader.

421
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,960
And he wants to turn the people of Africa into his slaves once again.

422
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
But this is just half the map.

423
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Where is the other half of this?

424
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
With my younger brother, Ghanu.

425
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,960
My father told this map into two and gave one half each to both of us.

426
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
So where is your brother now?

427
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,960
When Girboro didn't get the map anywhere in the village,

428
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,960
he sent his soldiers chasing us in the jungle.

429
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
My brother Ghanu ran away inside the jungle.

430
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Girboro soldiers also followed him into the jungle.

431
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I couldn't be of any help to him.

432
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I got so scared.

433
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Look at this! Back lights!

434
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,960
This means the sun will shine and there will be rain too.

435
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Finally, there will be some rain in Dholakorn.

436
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
And then we jump off right down in the puddles.

437
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
What's going on?

438
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Aha, beam.

439
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Children come come.

440
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Kalia and Hulu-Hulu are already here to see my kitchen robot.

441
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Kitchen robot?

442
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Yes.

443
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Made of glass, my helper in the kitchen can do so many jobs.

444
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Oh!

445
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Oh!

446
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Oh!

447
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Daddy even screamed like Kaya.

448
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Oh no, it's this. The robot is out of control.

449
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Hey, don't move.

450
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Why are you making it?

451
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Chase me or not?

452
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,960
You will just try to make an omelet for your boss.

453
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
This way I'll become an omelet myself.

454
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Help me! Help me!

455
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Help me!

456
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Help me!

457
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Help me!

458
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
No, no, no. We had only pressed a few buttons.

459
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Thank goodness! You did not press all the buttons.

460
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Is the remote not working properly, Professor?

461
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Do you know?

462
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
No, beam. This will not stop now.

463
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
But we have to stop it.

464
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
And Kalia will be in danger.

465
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Help me! Help me!

466
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Help me!

467
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Help me!

468
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Help me!

469
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Help me!

470
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Help me!

471
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I am sorry, Professor.

472
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I only wanted to stop the robot from hurting Kalia.

473
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Not breaking.

474
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
I know, beam.

475
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
It's good that this glass is of a different kind.

476
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
And I can fix it.
